# Blog mentions

## What it is

Blog mentions are counts of mentions to scholarly works, such as articles and books, from selected blogs. 


## How it works
Some services (e.g., Altmetric, PlumX) track mentions only for scholarly works that have been assigned a persistent identifier such as a DOI, ARK, or handle. Links from both scholarly and general interest blogs are tracked, though coverage of specific sources differs between altmetrics services.


## What to keep in mind
*Blog mentions may be a leading indicator of later citation.* Discussions on blogs have been found to have a small to moderate correlation to later citations [1, 2]. They are not a definitive indicator for later citations. Blog mentions of recently published research outputs accumulate fairly quickly [3], with nearly 80% of these events taking place during the first year after publication.

*The number of blog mentions is less important than what is being said.* Blog mentions can be useful for learning what other researchers or members of the public are saying about a scholarly work. 

*The count of blog mentions captured by any one source is incomplete.* Multiple sources are necessary to get a relatively complete picture of what blogs are discussing any particular publication.

*The coverage of blog mentions by altmetric aggregators differs significantly.” While there is some (28.8%) overlap between Altmetric and PlumX in the publications covered, there is far less overlap in coverage when counting individual mentions or events [4]. While PlumX may have greater coverage of publications, Altmetric covers nearly double the number of blog sources and generally includes more mentions [3]. Finally, PlumX miscounts many bibliographic citations from publishers such as Hindawi and the OMICS Publishing Group as blog mentions [4].

*The overall number of publications mentioned in blogs is low.* Several studies have confirmed that most publications are not mentioned in blogs [4, 5].
