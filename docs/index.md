# Helping You Navigate the Research Metrics Landscape

The Metrics Toolkit provides evidence-based information about research metrics across disciplines, including how each metric is calculated, where you can find it, and how each should (and should not) be applied. Youâ€™ll also find examples of how to use metrics in grant applications, CV, and promotion packages.
